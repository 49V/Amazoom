# Amazoom Automated Warehouse

To create system software that controls the production of a Amazoom warehouse 
by managing deliveries from the warehouse, and the stocking of the warehouse, 
using robots, trucks, and an inventory that is managed by a warehouse computer. 
The warehouse computer takes orders from the web server, and if the desired item
is in stock, will use robots to fulfill the orders by loading delivery trucks. 
Additionally, the warehouse computer will also manage stock deliveries by 
unloading delivery trucks and storing stock appropriately. These robots will be 
simulated using software that automatically determines the shortest path beteen
two coordinates. The warehouse manager is able to view details about the 
warehouse, through a UI that communicates with the warehouse computer.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on 
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env 
running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
